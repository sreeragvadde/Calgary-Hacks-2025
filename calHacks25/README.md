# Interactive Globe

## Description

The Interactive Globe is a project visualizing critically endangered species around the world. From the 7 continents to our oceans, this project aims to raise awareness in wildlife conservation.

## How to Check the Front End

To check the front end, you can open the `index.html` file located in the `dist/globe` directory using a live server. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `dist/globe` directory.
2. Open `index.html` with a live server.

This will allow you to view the front end of the project in your web browser.

## Future Edits

The future edits include connecting the project with the Red List API of endangered species and making a fully working model.

## Inspiration

The lack of interactive education based on endangered species inspired us to create this project.

## What it does

The project features a 3D globe with information about some endangered species.

## How we built it

We used C++ for the backend and Python and JavaScript for the frontend.

## Challenges we ran into

We faced challenges in connecting the three platforms together.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to run the three platforms independently without any errors.

## What we learned

We learned how to use APIs better.

## What's next for Wild Frame

The next steps for Wild Frame include connecting it with the Red List API to get data on endangered species and integrating all three platforms.
